# Unfresh Facebook

## Chrome extention to hide fresh content at https://www.facebook.com/

This chrome extension is intended to hide fresh content from the Facebook Homepage, while 
leaving old content in place. This version is coded to make anything newer than 7am go away.

The hope is that this will remove some of the tempation to check facebook for updates too often. 
With this extention you will only need to check Facebook once per day. Nothing new will appear until the next day.

This is my first attempt at making a Chrome extension, and it is very much a work in progress, and could break things. For now it is
probably better not to install it unless you have the technical knowledge to evaluate for yourself what it does and how it works. For that
reason I do not include any installation instructions.
